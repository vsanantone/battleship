# Written Reflection

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

    - We were both accustomed to the traditional game of Battleship. This allowed us to conceptualize the needed steps that a traditional interaction pattern would have provided such as (start of game, ship placement, order of actions), and so on. We utilized a runner file to support most of our testing for the code that we wrote in our `Game` class. Although we did not get far in iteration 3, we are excited that we do have the `start_game` functionality to operate.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

    - If we had just one more day to work on the Battleship project, we would focus on getting through Iteration 3. Although we did not get as far as we would have liked on this project, we do believe that we have made great progress in comparison to our Solo Projects.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

    - We really focused on paired programming for the majority of this project. We utilized Zoom to complete this task and we broke down the iterations into smaller chunks that we branched out. We would take turns completing a portion of code and tests, and then switch to ensure we were targeting our goals with commits and PR's.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

    - We received feedback in various ways, but we mostly utilized GitHub by creating commits and sharing comments. We also received feedback from our check-ins with Dani, our Turing instructor, as well as other programming mentors that reviewed our code. All of this feedback was critical in getting us through as much of our project as we could.
